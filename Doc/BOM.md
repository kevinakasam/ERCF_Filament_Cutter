| Qty | Part                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | [**180° Servo MR996**](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0C1TXW74L?psc=1)             | This is the servo I use, nothing special, but MG90S servos are definitely too weak. Ensure the servo has a rotation range of **180 degrees**! Check the torque; u/BioKeks wasn't able to cut soft PLA with a 12kg.cm servo.         |
| 1   | {5V Buck Converter](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Converter-Step-Down-Regulator-Adjustable-Downward/dp/B0D7BWSTCX/)                | Prevents the ERCF board shutdown caused by the servo's high current draw. Can be wired to the PSU or used with a dedicated 5V PSU.                                                                                                  |
| 1   | Exacto Knife Blade No. 11        | Example shape/type for reference. Higher quality blades are recommended for longer-lasting performance.                                                                                                                             |
| -   | Wire to Extend Servo Motor Cable | Use any cable you have on hand to extend the servo wire, as it is too short. Ensure the wire can handle the peak current of the servo motor.                                                                                        |
| 1   | Round Servo Horn                 | To mount the Servo Gear to the servo.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 4+  | Zip Ties                         | Same zip ties used during the ERCF assembly.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 1   | ECAS or PC4-M10                  | Choose based on preference; both versions of the cutter arm are provided.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 12  | M3 Threaded Insert               | Same inserts used during the ERCF assembly.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 1   | M2 Threaded Insert (3.2 OD)      | Inserting these can be tricky, take your time. 😉                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 1   | M3 Lock Nut                      | Prevents the screw on the cutter arm from loosening over time.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 5   | M3 Washer                        | Used for securing the cutter arm and the servo hinge mount.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1   | M3x18 SHCS                       | Screw used to mount the cutter arm.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 6   | M3x6 SHCS                        | Used at multiple mounting points.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
